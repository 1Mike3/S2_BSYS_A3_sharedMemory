# Assignment 3 Kuc

## Compile Information
* The executable has to be in a separate folder from the source files in the same <br>
  parent directory for the paths to work .<br> <br>
* Build in CLion 

## General
* I am using r_ and s_ to differentiate between the files associated with the <br>
receiver and sender executable
* Note to self: for your own sanity only work on s or r at a time
* I created a shared folder which contains resources that are used by both S&R
* allocating memory for both the ringbuffer structure and the ringbuffer itself

## Programming notes
* create ringbuffer should be changed to initalize ringbuffer as it is kinda useless now after the changes
